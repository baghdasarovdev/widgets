# Attention

## Setting Up Private Package Registry

To use private packages from GitHub Packages in your project, you need to configure your npm registry settings and generate a GitHub personal access token. Follow these steps:

### 1. Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Log in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account.

2. **Navigate to Developer Settings**:

   - Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner of the page.
   - Select **Settings**.
   - In the left sidebar, click **Developer settings**.

3. **Create a New Personal Access Token**:

   - Click **Personal access tokens**.
   - Click the **Generate new token** button.
   - **Note**: For enhanced security, use a GitHub App instead of personal access tokens if possible.

4. **Configure the Token**:

   - **Token description**: Enter a description for the token (e.g., "NPM package access").
   - **Select scopes**: Check the boxes for the following scopes:
     - `read:packages` (Required for installing packages)
     - `delete:packages` (Optional, if you need to delete packages)
   - Optionally, you can select other scopes based on your needs.

5. **Generate the Token**:
   - Click **Generate token** at the bottom of the page.
   - **Important**: Copy the token and save it somewhere secure. You wonâ€™t be able to see it again.

### 2. Configure `.npmrc` for Private Package Registry

1. **Create a `.npmrc` file**: This file should be located in the root directory of your project.

2. **Add the following configuration to `.npmrc`**:

   ```ini
   @resido-fhm:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
   //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

   - Replace `@resido-fhm` with the scope of your private packages.
   - Replace `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token you generated in the previous step.

3. **Save the `.npmrc` file**.

After setting up the `.npmrc` file, you can install and publish packages from GitHub Packages as you would with any other npm registry.

### Important Notes

- Keep your `.npmrc` file secure and avoid committing it to version control if it contains sensitive information.
- Use environment variables or GitHub Actions secrets to handle tokens securely in CI/CD pipelines.

For more details on configuring npm with GitHub Packages, refer to [GitHub's documentation on npm package publishing](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/publishing-and-managing-packages-with-npm).
